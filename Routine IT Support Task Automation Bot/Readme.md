# IT Support Automation with RPA - Ticket Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset related to customer support tickets in an IT environment. The dataset includes various fields such as customer information, ticket details, and resolution data. The goal is to identify repetitive tasks within this dataset that can be automated using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to enhance the efficiency of IT support processes.


## Identified Repetitive Tasks for RPA Automation

1. **Ticket Categorization and Routing:**
   - Automate the categorization of tickets based on type and route them to the relevant teams.
