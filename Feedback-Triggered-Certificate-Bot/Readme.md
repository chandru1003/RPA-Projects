# Feedback-Triggered Certificate Bot

## Description

Welcome to the "Feedback-Triggered Certificate Bot" project, a powerful automation solution designed to simplify the process of generating and distributing certificates to individuals who have provided feedback via email. This project aims to enhance efficiency and personalization in the certificate issuance process.

### Key Components

**Email Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors a designated email account for incoming feedback emails. This feature ensures that feedback is promptly acknowledged.

**Certificate Generation**: The project includes a certificate generation module that produces personalized certificates for each recipient. Variables like the recipient's name, feedback content, and relevant achievement details are incorporated into the certificates.
